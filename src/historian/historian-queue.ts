/**
 * R3 Historian worker queue (issue #8 Phase B Feature B2).
 *
 * A bounded, single-worker, GLOBAL serial queue:
 *
 *   highest → active Session pressure-critical incremental
 *   normal  → rollover continuity wrapup
 *   low     → closed Session retry
 *   manual  → recomp maintenance
 *
 * Guarantees:
 *  - at most ONE Historian job runs at any moment (single writer);
 *  - enqueue() never blocks the Pi main turn loop (fire-and-forget);
 *  - per-Session single-flight: a Session with a pending/queued job is not
 *    enqueued twice (the runner re-freezes on each run, so a newer job is
 *    unnecessary while one is queued/running);
 *  - job identity is a deterministic (priority, sessionId, runId, attempt);
 *  - retries are bounded (maxAttempts) and jobs survive shutdown by being
 *    re-enqueued from the durable session cursor on the next startup (the
 *    cursor never advanced on failure ⇒ nothing is lost);
 *  - rollover does NOT wait for wrapup: wrapup is enqueued at `normal` and
 *    the new Session starts immediately (B6);
 *  - the worker never runs in parallel with another Historian writer (the
 *    single worker loop IS the only writer).
